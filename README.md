## What is Rule-Based Classification?

"Rule-based classification is a technique for sorting data points into predefined categories by applying a set of predefined rules. Imagine it like a series of checkpoints or filters. Each data point goes through these checkpoints, and depending on whether it meets the criteria set in each rule, it gets assigned to a specific class..

Rule-based classification is a valuable tool for specific situations, particularly for smaller datasets where interpretability and speed are important. However, for larger and more complex datasets, other machine learning methods like decision trees or neural networks might be more suitable due to their adaptability and ability to handle intricate data."

## Business Case

"A game company wants to leverage its customers' data to create new level-based customer definitions (personas). They aim to segment their player base and estimate the average revenue potential of new customers based on these segments.

For example:

The company wants to determine the average potential earnings of a new player who is:
25 years old.
Male.
From Turkey.
An iOS user."

## The story of the dataset

"The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products sold by an international game company and some demographic information of the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. This means that the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with certain demographic characteristics may have made more than one purchase."

- **PRICE:** Customer's spending amount
- **SOURCE:** The type of device the customer is connecting to
- **SEX:** Gender of the customer
